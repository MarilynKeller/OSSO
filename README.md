# OSSO: Obtaining Skeletal Shape from Outside (CVPR 2022)

This repository contains the official implementation of the skeleton inference from:

**OSSO: Obtaining Skeletal Shape from Outside** <br>*Marilyn Keller, Silvia Zuffi, Michael J. Black and Sergi Pujades* <br>[Full paper](https://download.is.tue.mpg.de/osso/OSSO.pdf) | [Project website](https://osso.is.tue.mpg.de/index.html#Dataset) 


Given a body shape with SMPL or STAR topology (in blue), we infer the underlying skeleton (in yellow).

## Installation
Please follow the installation instruction in [installation.md](installation.md) to setup all the required packages and models.


## Run skeleton inference

The skeleton can be inferred either from a [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/) or [STAR](https://github.com/ahmedosman/STAR) mesh.

``` 
python main.py  --mesh_input data/demo/body_female.ply --gender female -D -v
```

The final infered skeleton will be saved in the `out` folder and the intermediate meshes in `out/tmp`.

## Acknowledgements

OSSO uses the [Stitched Puppet](https://stitch.is.tue.mpg.de/) by Silvia Zuffi and Michael J. Black, and the body model [STAR](https://github.com/ahmedosman/STAR) by Ahmed Osman et al. The model was applied on [AGORA](https://agora.is.tue.mpg.de/) (Priyanka Patel et al.) for demonstration.
